## LDTS_1204 - TETRIS

### GAME DESCRIPTION

Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle game where the player attempt to clear as many lines as possible by completing horizontal rows of blocks without empty space, but if the blocks surpass the skyline the game is over! 

To do this, the game requires players to strategically rotate, move, and drop several blocks of different shapes that fall into the rectangular arena at increasing speeds. 

The completed lines disappear and grant the player points.

There are levels of difficulties which rises as the game is being played.

It ends when the playing field is filled. The longer the player can delay this outcome, the higher the score will be.

This project was developed by Bruna Marques (up202007191@edu.fe.up.pt), Ana Carolina Brand√£o (up202004461@edu.fc.up.pt) and Miguel Curval (up201105191@edu.fe.up.pt).
